GK MOCK TEST - UPDATED PROJECT

Upload the contents of this folder to the root of your existing Vercel/GitHub project, keeping folders as shown.

Question banks:
- js/exams/gk-sets.js: 10 existing GK sets
- js/exams/bihar-police.js: 4 existing Bihar Police mocks
- js/exams/bpsc-prelims.js: starter bank; add verified BPSC questions here
- js/data.js: combines banks for the existing app

Modes:
- Practice Mode: instant correct/wrong feedback (existing behaviour)
- Exam Mode: no answer reveal while attempting; change answers, mark for review, submit, then review all answers

Question schema: {t: topicIndex, e: English question, h: Hindi question, o: [[English,Hindi] x 4], a: correct option index, x: optional explanation}

Existing feedback/footer files are retained. The existing question sets are preserved; one existing GK set contains 73 questions, so its actual count is shown dynamically.

BPSC: js/exams/bpsc-prelims.js now holds BPSC Prelims Mock Test 1 (72nd CCE, Set-4: 150 questions, 120 min, with explanations). Add more BPSC sets as extra arrays inside window.GKMockBanks.bpscPrelims.
